"""macOS launcher for the frozen Linux-oriented invsqrt sources.

Runs SCRIPT exactly as `python SCRIPT ARGS...` would, with one environment shim:
macOS rejects lowering RLIMIT_AS (ValueError/OSError), which several hash-pinned
sources call at import time. The shim turns only that rejected call into a no-op;
memory is bounded externally by tools/memguard.sh. No pinned file is modified and
no circuit, proof or verifier check is touched.
