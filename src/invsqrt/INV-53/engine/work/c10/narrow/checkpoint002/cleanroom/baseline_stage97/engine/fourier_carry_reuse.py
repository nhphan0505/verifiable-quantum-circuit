"""Reuse a conditionally computed Fourier carry for its simultaneous S phase.

When the odd suffix outcome is one, the existing signed-T correction already
computes the majority into a temporary wire.  In that branch its signed-S
correction is S^-1(carry) CZ(sign, carry), which costs no T gates.  The original
four-T majority formula is needed only when twice is one and odd is zero.

The public installation scope changes only this local phase-repayment helper.
All adders, carry ownership, measurements, and constant terms remain exact.
