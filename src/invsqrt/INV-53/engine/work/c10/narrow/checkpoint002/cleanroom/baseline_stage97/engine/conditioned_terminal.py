"""Exact branch-local terminal carry reuse for the paired inverse adder.

This opt-in pass acts on an inverse terminal whose two high source bits
are zero and whose overflow sign is controlled by an HMR outcome. The
ordinary terminal costs one data CCX plus one conditioned CCZ: 1.5 mean
Toffolis. Its measurement-one branch instead consumes two earlier carry
frames, reuses one cleared wire for the terminal product, and phases that
product by CZ. One new HMR debt is a composition of two borrow majorities;
its cubic part has one product and needs one conditioned CCZ. Thus the
branch costs 1.5, the zero branch costs 1, and the mean is 1.25.

All live data and both recycled carry wires have the same final state in
both branches. No quantum wire is allocated by the replacement. This is a
generator pass, not a gate sequence extracted from a compiled circuit.
