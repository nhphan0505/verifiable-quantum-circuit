"""An exact Fourier terminal which conditionally recycles two carry frames.

The existing signed-T carry phase needs one extra clean wire.  When its odd
classical outcome is one, the last two ordinary carry frames can instead be
consumed early and one cleared allocation reused for that phase.  Measuring
the remaining old carry introduces the composition of two borrow majorities;
its only cubic term is repaid by one conditioned CCZ.  Thus this alternative
uses one less clean wire and costs one quarter of a Toffoli more in mean.
The partition selector chooses it only when saved boundary recomputation is
strictly larger.  No measurement debt leaves the enclosing inverse adder.
