"""Share the final packed decoder with the complete thermometer cleanup basis.

This is an opt-in source component.  Install its adapter outside the existing
PackedThresholdPhasePass scope.  It is intended for the selected schedule's
single final unpack, followed by inverse normalization with thermometer
cleanup.  No model, compiled circuit, saved plan, or numerical table is read.

The packed state retains t=[k>0] and four residual positions.  For k>=2 those
positions contain (f1, f2 XOR f3, f0, f3); k=0/1 may have residual data in the
positions where the packing contract permits it.  Nine exact products expose
a complete ten-dimensional basis of functions of k in 0..10.  A freshly
derived Clifford frame makes these the monomials with masks 1..10.  Four of
the wires serve as ordinary flags during inverse routing, and all ten are
later reused by the existing thermometer erasure.
