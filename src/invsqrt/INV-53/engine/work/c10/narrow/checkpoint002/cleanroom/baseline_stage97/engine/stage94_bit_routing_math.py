"""Exact binary butterfly for zero-supported normalization payloads.

After removing the leading one, a twenty-two-bit positive word has a
twenty-one-bit payload.  If ell is its original leading-zero count, every
live payload symbol at position i satisfies i+ell <= 20.  A low-bit-first
binary butterfly adds ell to each physical position label.

At stage j the lower position bits have already been added.  Their carry
is therefore [position mod 2**j < ell mod 2**j].  XORing this carry with
bit j of ell gives the exact selector for the pair differing in bit j.
Virtual pairs outside the payload contain zero throughout every valid
case, so they need no physical wires or gates.  All controls are freshly
derived functions of ell, available as parities of its prefix thresholds.
