"""Freshly synthesized zero-supported normalization at the original width.

The three highest count flags encode six coarse shifts of four-bit blocks.
Two lanes have six positions and two have five. Known leading zero support
permits a cheaper common exchange network than three independent binary
shifts. The network and every control polynomial are freshly derived by a
finite integer search; no saved plan, numerical table, or circuit is read.

An affine selector borrows a count flag in a temporary CNOT frame. A
quadratic selector uses one clean helper with exact X measurement and
conditional Z/CZ repayment. Its inputs are restored before every erasure.
The inverse reverses the certified routing and recomputes its selectors.
