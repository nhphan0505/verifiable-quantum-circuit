"""Retain captured u and g9 through high decoding and consume both once.

This isolated adapter requires the explicit optional-owner interfaces in
tooling/owned_initial_controls_interfaces.patch.  It does not edit production files.
Install it inside SharedNormalizationCleanupPass and outside refined build.

The original prefix supplies g9=[k>=9] by one additional CNOT copy.  Captured
u=[k>=2] is retained coherently at pack.  The high callback borrows both exact
wires; its existing threshold erasure and outer higher_nonzero cleanup own
their HMR outcomes in the original two ledgers.  Final unpack repays both.
