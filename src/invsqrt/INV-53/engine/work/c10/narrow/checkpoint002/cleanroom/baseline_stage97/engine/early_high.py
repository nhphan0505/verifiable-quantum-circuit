"""Consume H0..6 before inverse tail-delta, retaining an exact phase ledger.

The production generator is never rewritten. This module changes one lifetime:
HMR acts on H_j XOR g9*D_j, the mixed sign is repaid on the preserved static
bank, and the remaining H_j sign transfers to DeferredTablePhases. The seven
zero allocations remain owned until the initializer converter consumes their
explicit single-use contract. H7 and the entire static bank are restored.
