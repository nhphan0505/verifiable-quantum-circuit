"""prodcoef patch SEEDINV: retire raw v0, v1, v3 over the whole inverse product,
then recover them by running the three seed rows backwards.

Facts used (exact, from the seed forward in the seed root frame):
  seed row j (j=0,1,2) has sign s_j = NOT c_j with c = (v0', v1', v3') and its
  sign copy is appended as seed[3+j] = s_j; rows j+1.. then add into seed[3+j].
After the inverse product restores the seed, inverting seed row 2 (sign wire
seed[5]) returns seed[4] = s1; inverting row 1 (sign seed[4]) returns
seed[3] = s0; inverting row 0 (sign seed[3]) returns seed[0:3] = 111.  So the
three sign wires ARE NOT v0', NOT v1', NOT v3': one X each, then the unchanged
seed-root inverse frame gives raw v0, v1, v3 on those wires, where their HMR
outcomes are paid by Z.  The six seed carry debts are paid natively by the
three inverse rows.  No helper, no phase plan, no fresh wire.

Cost: inverse product runs with 41 data owners (vs 43), seed rows inverse 9,
frame inverse 1.  Replaces lifecycle.product_inverse and baseline.seed_cleanup.
