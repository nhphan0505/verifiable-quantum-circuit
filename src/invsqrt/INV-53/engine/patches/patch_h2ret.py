"""prodcoef2 patch H2RET: retire the second-table metadata bit H2 through the whole inverse product + seed cleanup
(one more clean wire for every inverse adder row) and rebuild it with 3 Toffolis before the late metadata (T1).

Measured fact (full domain, Q46 raw build pc2_q46a, op 22342 = inverse_product_data; 39 reachable rows of 64):
H2 is a function of D9, D10, D11, D12, H0, H1 only, and the exact minimum-AND search (tools/minand_sat.py) gives
k=1 UNSAT, k=2 UNSAT, k=3 SAT:
    H2 = D10 ^ D11 ^ D12 ^ (D9^D11)(D9^H1) ^ g0*M,   g0 = (D9^D10^D11^H1)(D10^H0),   M = D9^D10^D11^D12^H0^H1.
D (post second coefficient forward), H0 and H1 are unchanged through the inverse product (source / dirty spectators).
H2's last use before the inverse product is the H3 erasure of the second erase_high_H call; next use is T1.
Steps: X-measure H2 at the start of product_inverse (removed from the dirty list); after seed_cleanup rebuild it on a
fresh wire (3 CCX; the temporary g0 is X-measured, its sign paid by CZ on its two factors); pay H2's outcome by Z on
the rebuilt owner; the body's Hlow list (the object returned by erase_high_H) gets the new owner in place.
Wraps baseline.erase_high_H, lifecycle.product_inverse and baseline.seed_cleanup (all delegate). Apply AFTER
patch_seedinv.py (and after patch_coef2_q46.py if used).
