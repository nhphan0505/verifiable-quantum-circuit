"""Agent width (FIRST LOADER ONLY variant, for Q47 builds where the second loader is Pro 2 second90): transplant candidate11r2's first60 / second78 loaders (Pro 2 port03) by native-text replay.

The donor loaders differ from candidate10's first61 / second79 only in their final segment (measured, rename-aware
diff). Their gate text is replayed from the donor kmx through our builder (plans/L1_first60.json,
plans/L2_second78.json made by scripts/make_replay_plan.py on the full domain): scratch owners are allocated at first
touch and freed when the donor wire is identically zero; every donor HMR is re-emitted as TableDebts.erase with the
measured 128-row truth of the raw table address, so OUR shared table cleanup (universal flush) repays it.
Replaces only tables07.load_joint16 (per variant; env WIDTH_DONOR_L1 / WIDTH_DONOR_L2, default both on).
