"""Narrow forward normalization: same 18+1+32 Toffolis, no conditional CCZ, local peak 37 instead of 46.

Changes against normalization9475.forward (inverse untouched, n22/flags4 interface identical):
1. P1 = NOT x21 gets no wire: X(x21) turns x21 into P1; it is used as a CX source while it is P1 and then
   becomes the H accumulator (H = 1 xor P1 xor ... xor P20 xor P20*NOT x1), so it is never measured.
2. Every odd prefix P_(L-1) is measured right after P_L is computed and its CX uses are done. Its HMR
   fix-up uses the running parity x21 = 1 xor sum_(l<=L) P_l:
       P_(L-1) = P_(L-2) xor P_(L-2)*x21 xor P_L*x21      (L even)  -> Z/CZ only.
   The leading-one clearing of position 22-L, and the x0/x1/H accumulations, are done as soon as P_L
   exists (position 22-L is no longer needed as data). x1 is accumulated early; when P20 = 1 all
   P1..P19 are 1, so the accumulated x1' equals NOT x1 and CCX(P20, x1', x21) is the base H gate.
3. Thresholds are erased with the neighbour trick of patch_fwd_neighbor (no conditional CCZ).
