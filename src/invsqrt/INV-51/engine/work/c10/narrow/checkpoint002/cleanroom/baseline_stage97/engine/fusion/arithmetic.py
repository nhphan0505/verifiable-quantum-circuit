"""Segmented measurement-carry addition, derived for this generator.

A carry boundary is kept while the interior carries of a segment are erased.
After every sum bit is final, the boundary is measured and the resulting sign
is repaid by a borrow comparator in the measurement-one branch.  The identity
is carry(a+b+c) = borrow((a+b+c) mod 2**n - a - c).

Only the comparator's interior carries are computed.  Its last carry is phased
by the exact quadratic identity majority(a,b,c) = ab XOR ac XOR bc, so that
last step needs only CZ gates.
